    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>1/4 cup (35g) plain flour        </li>
        <li> 3/4 cup (50g) stale breadcrumbs </li>
        <li> 4 x 150g skinless white fish fillets (about 1.5cm thick), pin-boned </li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) rice bran oil, to shallow-fry</li>
        <li> 4 soft round buns, split </li>
        <li> Shredded iceberg lettuce, to serve</li>
        <li> 1 large Lebanese cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup (60ml) apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li> 1 tsp sugar        </li>
        <li>1 tsp salt        </li>
        <li> 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper        </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup (150g) mayonnaise        </li>
        <li> Finely grated zest of 1 lemon        </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup dill leaves, finely chopped        </li>
        <li>1/2 small red onion, very finely chopped        </li>

    </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a shallow bowl and place the flour (seasoned with salt and pepper) and breadcrumbs onto separate plates. Dip a fish fillet into the flour, shake off the excess, then dip into the egg and shake off the excess. Coat in breadcrumbs, pressing on gently.</li>
        <li>Place on a baking tray and repeat until all fish is coated. For the quick pickle, combine the cucumber, vinegar, sugar, salt and cayenne pepper in a glass or ceramic bowl. Cover and place in the fridge until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>For the herbed mayo, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl or jar. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat half the oil in a non-stick frypan over medium heat. Working with 2 pieces of fish at a time, cook for 2-3 minutes each side until golden and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towel, and repeat with the remaining fish. </li>
        <li> To assemble, spread the bottom half of each bun with a generous helping of the mayo. Layer the lettuce, then top with fish, pickle and bun top.</li>
    </ol>
